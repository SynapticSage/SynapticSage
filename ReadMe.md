Hi there!

I'm Ryan.

I'm a quantitative programmer completing a PhD in Neuroscience under Dr. Shantanu Jadhav.

My work spans brain rhythms and temporal representations for solving memory-guided tasks. I have extensive experience in time-series analysis and Bayesian decoding, and experience with emerging statistical sequence models.

On the side, I'm passionate about climbing ðŸ§—, choir ðŸŽµ, dance ðŸ‘¯, replicating AI/statistics ðŸ¤– papers, and emerging dialogues between neurocience and AI/engineering.

Looking ahead, I'm setting up projects in
- communication subspaces with tensor methods :: going beyond pair-wise communication
- successor models with policy streams :: expanding upon howard eichenbaum's vision
- content-targeted autoencoders :: filtering signals by content

Collabs welcome. Let's build something awesome ðŸ§¨. Enjoy :)
