Hi there!

I'm Ryan.

I'm a quantitative programmer completing a PhD in Neuroscience under Dr. Shantanu Jadhav.

My work spans brain rhythms and temporal representations for solving memory-guided tasks. I have extensive experience in time-series analysis, Bayesian decoding, and emerging statistical sequence models.

Looking forward, I'm planning projects in a few areas
- communication subspaces with tensor methods :: going beyond pair-wise communication
- successor models with factorized what, where, and policy streams :: extending Eichenbaum's model
- content-targeted autoencoders :: filtering signals by content

Collabs welcome. Let's build something awesome ðŸ§¨. Enjoy :)
