Hi there!

I'm Ryan.

I'm a quantitative programmer completing a PhD in Neuroscience under Shantanu Jadhav.

My work spans brain rhythms and temporal representations for solving memory-guided tasks. I have extensive experience in time-series analysis and bayesian decoding, and experience with emerging statistical sequence models.

My website â†’ ryanyoung.io (not completed, design in flux).

On the side, very passionate about climbing ðŸª¨, choir ðŸŽµ, dance ðŸ‘¯, replicating AI/ML ðŸ¤– paper models, and an emerging bidirectional dialogue between neuro and statistics.

Future-looking, I'm interested in
- communication subspaces with tensor methods :: n-adic communication modes
- heteroencoders for biological time-series :: fitlering signals by content
- successor models with policy streams :: expanding upon howard eichenbaum's vision

Collabs welcome. Let's build something awesome ðŸ§¨. Enjoy :)
